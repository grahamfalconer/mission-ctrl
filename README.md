# Mission Ctrl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tommyrharper/mission-ctrl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tommyrharper/mission-ctrl)

This was our final project at Makers Academ. The focus of the project was to take on a completely new tech stack and showcase our ability to follow AGILE processes and T.D.D when faced with such challenge.

# What is Mission-Ctrl?
Mission-ctrl is a game developed to help engineers hone their shortcut knowledge and practise them in a fun and competitive space ! 

We enable the user to reach great heights in our game with a sophisticated scoring system that allows them to enter their own name and save their score on our database.

Our game is built with custom event-listeners that can detect multiple key-presses at a time and give feedback to the user about their attempt.
